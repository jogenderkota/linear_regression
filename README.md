Linear-Regression
=======================
linear regression is the relationship between a scalar dependent variable Y and one or more independent variables X.
In this code we have done a multiple linear regression of random values of X[] and Y[].
We have also calculated the slope between X[] and Y[].


Linear-Regression using ANM
================================
As in the before code we have seen linear regression of any data in terms of X[] and Y[], we can do the same using ANM in which we have used the perceptron model, In this we have used a single layer perceptron for getting the slope of X[] and Y[].
  Further we will be seeing how the Multi Layer Perceptron works.
